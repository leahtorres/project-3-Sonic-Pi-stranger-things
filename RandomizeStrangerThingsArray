#This is parameterise with stranger things
TASK 1: Define a function that has 5 parameters (four notes and one sleep time). Hit "Run" and nothing should play.

TASK 2: Call your function and give it five arguments (the four notes on lines 16, 18, 20, & 22 plus the sleep time). Hit run and you should hear four notes play.

TASK 3: Call your function twice in a live_loop so the entire Stranger Things Theme repeats.
